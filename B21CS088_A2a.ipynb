    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implemented and trained a perceptron to classify the XOR logic gate using two inputs and a bias term. Despite the simplicity of the perceptron model, we observed that it was unable to solve the XOR problem effectively due to its linear nature. This behavior was evident as the weights failed to converge to a solution that could correctly classify all input-output pairs of the XOR gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative weight updates demonstrated that a single-layer perceptron struggles with non-linearly separable data, such as XOR. This highlights the necessity of using more advanced models, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) or neural networks with non-linear activation functions, to solve such problems."
